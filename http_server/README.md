About:
-----------
This is a web server written in the C++ programming language.  
The web server uses its own thread pool for thread organization and management.  
It also uses the winsock2.h library in its own class to manage network connections of http clients  
I am sharing the web server freely available for download and for further possible modifications and extensions.  


Starting webserver:
-------------------
./http_server --config=./http_server.conf
